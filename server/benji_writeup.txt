I was in charge of the backend for the application, and so far I've done the following

- Created a database module that
  - Loads the mongoDB
  - Allows all modules to load the mongoDB simply without worrying about when it boots up

- Created a custom login system that
  - Registers new users
  - Allows them to securely login
  - Keeps them logged in while preventing invalid data access
  - Allows them to logout
  - Created middleware that allows ensures the requester is logged in and passes the username to the next function

- Created a meals API that
  - Allows users to create new meals
  - Allows users to reserve seats at meals
  - Allows users to delete their meals

- Written tests that ensure the behavior of most of the above functions (logout isn't tested yet)

I've also set up a docker file that builds the mongo + express backend into
a single container that can be deployed to a VM

- Still to do
  - Allow users to see nearby meals
  - Allow users to see their own meals and edit them
  - Allow diners to review chefs and chefs to review diners
  - Test the remaining functions
